IMPROVEMENTS																																									
ID	Description
1	Add special symbols (*) to highlight the obligatiry fields
2	Add descriptions and hints about how to fill in the fields (e.g., the quantity of symbols, allowed symbols)
3	Add a hint under the field which appears immediately after incorrect filling in (e.g. when you fill in invalid number of symbols, there should be the information that you must add or delete symbols to reach the proper number of them)
4	Add function that helps a client to see his password 
5	Add the information about the personal data protection but not as a check-box because it can distract the client's attention, it's better to add this information at the bottom of the page
6	Instead of the prefilled "Name?", 'Surname?", "Your email adress" add the examples: Name - for example "Ivan"
7	Add the function of checking the validity of the email form  (if there is a @; if the gmail isn't written down as mgail or yandex isn't written as yamdex)
8	Replace "Submit" with "Sign up", because the customer needs to understand exactly what he is doing by filling in this form
9	Add some information about the website and this proper form to the page's title
10	Add the explanation why we need such personal information as a surname. If the surname isn't the first-priority information it's better to remove this field from the registration form. The smallest the number of the necessary field is, the biggest chance that the customer won't get tired while filling in the form. Moreover we can still ask the customer to add this information to his profile after registration. 
11	Add the gradation of the password's reliability
12	Add the possibility to sign up using the social media networks accounts
13	It will be user-friendly to preserve previously filled in data in the fields "name" and "surname" if the password or email were entered incorrectly and the page was restarted
